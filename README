This project is an Objective-C library which computes the result of (very simple for now) mathematical expressions.
Currently supported operations are additions, substractions, divisions, and multiplications. (Nested brackets are suported.)

It's composed of 3 classes : 
- An implementation of the shunting yard algorithm, which converts a string from infix to postfix notaation.
- A RPN calculator, which computes the result of a postfix expression.
- A "calculator" wrapper around those classes.
